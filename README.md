# Find-me-a-Garage
🚗 “Find Me A Garage” – UK-based car service platform | Case study of my QA role covering manual, API & and performance testing for customer and garage portals.

# 🚗 Find Me A Garage (Case Study)

### 🧪 Project Overview
This repository presents a **QA case study** of my work on the UK-based platform **“Find Me A Garage.”**

The system allows customers to easily **find and book car services online**, while giving **garage owners** the ability to:
- Set and manage service pricing
- Offer car rentals or replacement cars
- Manage bookings, availability, and customer requests

On the **customer side**, users can:
- Search garages by service type or location
- Compare prices and view ratings
- Book appointments, request pickup, or tow services

> 🔒 For confidentiality reasons, no proprietary code or internal data is shared.  
> This case study focuses on **QA processes, testing artifacts, and methodologies** used to ensure the platform’s quality and reliability.

## 🎯 My Contributions

### 🔹 Manual Testing
- Designed and executed **functional, regression, and usability test cases** for both the customer and garage owner portals.  
- Conducted **cross-browser and responsive testing** for consistent behavior across devices.  
- Verified **end-to-end booking workflows**, including payment confirmation and email notifications.  
- Reported and tracked bugs until resolution, ensuring clear documentation and validation.

### 🔹 API Testing
- Validated **REST API endpoints** (service listings, authentication, booking management) using **Postman**.  
- Verified request/response payloads, HTTP status codes, and response times.  
- Performed **positive, negative, and boundary testing** to ensure robust API performance.

### 🔹 Performance, Stress & Load Testing
- Used **Apache JMeter** to simulate real-world user load and measure site responsiveness.  
- Identified performance bottlenecks on booking and search features.  
- Shared optimization insights with the dev team prior to production releases.

### 🔹 Collaboration & Delivery
- Collaborated closely with developers to reproduce and isolate issues.  
- Performed **sanity and regression testing** before each release.  
- Contributed to final QA sign-off for deployment readiness.
